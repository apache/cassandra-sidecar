# Sidecar Development Guide

If you're reading this document then you've decided to contribute to the Sidecar for Apache Cassandra.

## Building

    ./gradlew build

Packages can be built using the following Gradle commands:

    ./gradlew buildDeb
    ./gradlew buildRpm

## Project Layout

### Common

Contains the libraries which are shared between the version specific Cassandra code as well as the dependencies of Cassandra itself.

### Cassandra40

Implementation of ICassandraAdapter for Cassandra 4.0.

### Cassandra Integration Tests

Cassandra integration tests leverage Docker to create Cassandra nodes and test the different implementations
of the ICassandraAdapters against real C* nodes.

The integration tests will not run by default when running `./gradlew test` since they require a bit of setup and you may not have
Kubernetes available.

#### Running Integration Tests

Integration tests can be run with the following:

    ./gradlew integrationTest



#### Tests

Tests in the cassandra-integration-tests submodule should be marked as integration tests with the @CassandraIntegrationTest annotation:

    @CassandraIntegrationTest
    void myTestHere(CassandraTestContext context)
    {
        //
    }

The `CassandraTestTemplate` will handle starting up each of the Kubernetes services required for testing and inject the
`CassandraTestContext`, which will have the version, CQLSession, container, and other useful information required for testing.

### Main Project

The main project consumes the various Cassandra versions via the CassandraAdapterDelegate.  When connecting to the server,
the delegate will discover the version and choose the best `ICassandraAdapter` to match the server version.


## Testing

Our official CI for this project is CircleCI.

We strive for high quality, thoroughly tested code.

Some tests require docker to be installed locally to run Cassandra.

## Issue Tracker

File bugs or look for issues to work on in our project JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRASC

## Submitting Patches

You may open a PR against our project: http://github.com/apache/cassandra-sidecar

Please link to the PR from the JIRA ticket.  All work *must* have a corresponding JIRA ticket.  Please put the JIRA ID in the body of the pull request.

# Apache Cassandra Sidecar [WIP]

This is a Sidecar for the highly scalable Apache Cassandra database.
For more information, see [the Apache Cassandra web site](http://cassandra.apache.org/) and [CIP-1](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=95652224).

**This is project is still WIP.**

Requirements
------------
  1. Java >= 1.8 (OpenJDK or Oracle), or Java 11
  2. Apache Cassandra 4.0.  We depend on virtual tables which is a 4.0 only feature.
  3. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for running integration tests.

Getting started: Running The Sidecar
--------------------------------------

After you clone the git repo, you can use the gradle wrapper to build and run the project. Make sure you have 
Apache Cassandra running on the host & port specified in `conf/sidecar.yaml`.

    $ ./gradlew run
  
Configuring Cassandra Instance
------------------------------

While setting up cassandra instance, make sure the data directories of cassandra are in the path stored in sidecar.yaml file, else modify data directories path to point to the correct directories for stream APIs to work.

Testing
-------

We rely on docker containers for integration tests.

The only requirement is to install and run [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on your test machine.

CircleCI Testing
-----------------

You will need to use the "Add Projects" function of CircleCI to set up CircleCI on your fork.  When promoted to create a branch, 
do not replace the CircleCI config, choose the option to do it manually.  CircleCI will pick up the in project configuration.
